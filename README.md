## 🔹 Option 1 — Generate with Python 3

   ```bash
   python3 --version
   ```

2. Run the generator script:  
   ```bash
   python3 wordlist_gen.py
   ```

3. This will create a file:  
   ```
   pldt_wordlist.txt
   ```

4. (Optional) Compress it to save space:  
   ```bash
   7z a pldt_wordlist.7z pldt_wordlist.txt
   ```
